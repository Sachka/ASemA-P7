Distributional Thesauri for French
==================================

This release includes one distributional thesaurus file for each of four
different part-of-speech categories: adjectives, adverbs, common nouns, and
verbs. Each line of the file corresponds to a lexical term's entry in the
thesaurus, and is of the tab-separated form:

<term>	<neighborterm1>:<neighborsim1>	<neighborterm1>:<neighborsim2>	...

Where neighbor terms are ordered in descending similarity, and all similarity
scores are between 0 and 1. Neighbors with similarity scores of 0 are not
included in the entry. Additionally, all terms are lemmatized and appear in a
| separated form with POS tag and lemma. There are a total of 3,245 
adjectives, 707 adverbs, 9448 common nouns, and 2545 verbs.

Only the 100-nearest neighbors are included in each entry, for compactness.

Due to the fully automatic nature of the part-of-speech tagging and syntactic
parsing processes, there is some noise in the lemmatization and distributional
similarities found in the thesaurus.

Partial example for the adverb 'toutefois':
ADV|toutefois	ADV|cependant:0.66187516606	ADV|néanmoins:0.520516424154
